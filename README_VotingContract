This program aligns with my mentorship with William & Mary Blockchain Lab, which focused on creating a prototype voting system using blockchain that allows instructors to submit syllabus drafts for administrator approval while facilitating the approval process. A syllabus must reach a 2/3 approval rating in order to pass. Due to the virtual nature of the mentorship, the program was not completed before the end of the school year. However, work will continue on it.

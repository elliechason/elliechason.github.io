README for the programs "dbInterface" and "ER5CMigration"

Jefferson Lab’s Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, CEBAF for short, is composed of thermal structures called cryomodules. These cryomodules consist of series of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Cryomodules and their SRF cavities require extensive maintenance, and the data gathered from cryomodule and component production, assembly, and performance testing are stored in documents called travelers. Travelers are organized by project, which group travelers with shared attributes together. Because the C20, C50R (revised version of C50 project), and C75 projects all share similar attributes, a new project containing all three of the project’s travelers will be created. This new project is named ER5C, short for Energy Reach 5 Cell, and uses an updated traveler format and naming convention. Traveler Word files, HTM files, and ColdFusion pages must be updated as well to reflect the new changes, and that information from the travelers’ tables in the Oracle database must be pulled and inserted into the new project’s travelers’ tables. This requires the use of SQL for actual database manipulation and Go for managing SQL queries. 

The SQL script operates in SQL Developer where the Pansophy Oracle database can be directly. The similar column names between the old traveler table and new ER5C traveler table are stored in an inner query, while the outer query returns the data in those columns. Once it was determined that the SQL script successfully returned the shared column names, the script was incorporated into a Go function that took the old and new traveler ids as parameters and stored the column names returned by the SQL script as a slice. This slice was then passed as an argument in an SQL INSERT statement that was queried through Go, which inserted the old traveler data in those columns into the new ER5C traveler’s columns.
